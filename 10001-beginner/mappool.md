## Pool Breakdown

### No Mod

- Festa Illumination [Fetsa Futsuu]

  This is aimed for people who want to learn to play a consistency check. A rather high OD may hinder a bit for *6ms* loss, however this map is pretty straightforward until the end.

- Nesin Amatias Song Selection Preview [ishikazumu]

  A ditty song, with a super slow scrolling notes. Who wonders about reading a very low star muzukashii... right? Wait. Muzukashii? Am i *supposed to read it backwards*?

- Aduh! [Tisoledat]

  Fast scroll test with speed change happened in the midway of the song. To note the ending is on tricky snap so you have to be precise on hitting it!

- Senkou no Brionac [Moderate Danger]

  Experimental mapping style to introduce the silliness of tricky/strange rhythm expression into the pool. This is not an easy map for beginners, as this is first challenge track from respective series.

### Hidden

- Flandre March [Pair]

  A simple normal speed hidden. A first-step to learn Hidden mod with simple song.
  
- Concealed the Conclusion "Extra Medley" [Easy]

  Fast scroll map. Don't worry.

- Furuki Yuanshen (RKT) [Seiga Futsuu Futsuu]

  A rhythmless spirit world edit of the song by ZUN. Introduction to a tough rhythm Hidden mod.

### Hard Rock

- Nerverakes [ADVANCED]

  Somewhat old map, this is one of tough futsuu with slow yet faster scroll.

- Fragrance [BASIC]

  A simple boosted scroll map. It's fun to play.

- Reiou [Fut]
  
  The very long Futsuu map deserves a no-place in Hidden.
 
### Double Time

- Remilia Pose [Futsuu]

  A short tricky DT map.

- Rolling Sankaku [4MIX]

  A calming long DT map. On some part of the practice, an endurance type of map that is not Tie Breaker is still part of endurance practice. This map is chill enough with DT.

- Flandre March (Hard) [*Pair*]

  A harder Flandre March! As you could expect, this is a faster version of Flandre March that you've encountered earlier. The map itself is rather simple what I could say.

### Hidden-Hard Rock

- Mopemope Kids Edition [Kodomotachi no Taiko Asobu]

  This map is meant to teach how to ghosttap along the song. The thing with this map is slow scroll and consistent rhythm. With hidden you may need time to process the input for sure, however due to "how low is the OD" of this map, ghosttapping in this map is extremely recommended. You'll feel the rhythm flowing out yourself when you enjoy this kids friendly edit of LeaF's.
  
### Free Mod

- Festa Illoopmination [Festa Fustuu]

  Another consistency map, however it's harder than the original version.

- ~~La Vie En Rose [REGULAR]~~

  A simple map. This map is particularly *slower* than you could expect as other **170 BPM maps are**.

- Angel Dream [ka-don]

  A simple map.

### Tie Breaker

- Sakasa Medley [Malron]

  A tricky timing map. To note that this map is against with Free Mod usage due to the nature of the map.
