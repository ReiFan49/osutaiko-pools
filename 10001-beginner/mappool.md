## Pool Breakdown

### No Mod

- Festa Illumination [Fetsa Futsuu]

  This is aimed for people who want to learn to play a consistency check. A rather high OD may hinder a bit for *6ms* loss, however this map is pretty straightforward until the end.

- Frost [Drenched]

  Some reading practice for beginners. Nothing to worry about!

- Memento? Momento? Rururu! [SOLO 4MIX]

  A high scroll speed test with some *forced branching*. Practice your fast hitting finisher skills here!

- Senkou no Brionac [Moderate Danger]

  Experimental mapping style to introduce the silliness of tricky/strange rhythm expression into the pool. This is not an easy map for beginners, as this is first challenge track from respective series.

### Hidden

- Flandre March [Pair]

  A simple normal speed hidden. A first-step to learn Hidden mod with simple song.
  
- Concealed the Conclusion "Extra Medley" [Easy]

  Fast scroll map. Don't worry.

- Furuki Yuanshen (RKT) [Seiga Futsuu Futsuu]

  A rhythmless spirit world edit of the song by ZUN. Introduction to a tough rhythm Hidden mod.

### Hard Rock

- Nerverakes [ADVANCED]

  Somewhat old map, this is one of tough futsuu with slow yet faster scroll.

- Fragrance [BASIC]

  A simple boosted scroll map. It's fun to play.

- Aduh! [Tisoledat]

  Fast scroll test with speed change happened in the midway of the song. To note the ending is on tricky snap so you have to be precise on hitting it!
 
### Double Time

- Remilia Pose [Futsuu]

  A short tricky DT map.

- Rolling Sankaku [4MIX]

  A calming long DT map. On some part of the practice, an endurance type of map that is not Tie Breaker is still part of endurance practice. This map is chill enough with DT.

- Flandre March (Hard) [*Pair*]

  A harder Flandre March! As you could expect, this is a faster version of Flandre March that you've encountered earlier. The map itself is rather simple what I could say.

### Free Mod

- Festa Illoopmination [Festa Fustuu]

  Another consistency map, however it's harder than the original version.

- Angel Dream [ka-don]

  A simple map.

- Ochiru Kajitsu [REGULAR]

  Are you sure about modding in here? Well, do whatever you want.

### Tie Breaker

- Sakasa Medley [Malron]

  A tricky timing map. To note that this map is against with Free Mod usage due to the nature of the map.

## Pooling Considerations

- Limited choice of uploaded beatmaps
- Want to aim for beginners, this may not fit for all. Hence all the inputs are welcomed!

## Pool Usage Instructions

- HD3/HR3/DT3 is optional.
