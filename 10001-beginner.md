## Pool Breakdown

### No Mod

- Festa Illumination [Fetsa Futsuu]

  This is aimed for people who want to learn to play a consistency check. A rather high OD may hinder a bit for *6ms* loss, however this map is pretty straightforward until the end.

- Nesin Amatias Song Selection Preview [ishikazumu]

  A ditty song, with a super slow scrolling notes. Who wonders about reading a very low star muzukashii... right? Wait. Muzukashii? Am i *supposed to read it backwards*?

- Aduh! [Tisoledat]

  Fast scroll test with speed change happened in the midway of the song. To note the ending is on tricky snap so you have to be precise on hitting it!

- Senkou no Brionac [Moderate Danger]

  Experimental mapping style to introduce the silliness of tricky/strange rhythm expression into the pool. This is not an easy map for beginners, as this is first challenge track from respective series.

### Hidden

- Flandre March [Pair]

  A simple normal speed hidden. A first-step to learn Hidden mod with simple song.
  
- Cutie Panther [*BASIC*]

  Fast hidden. However this map is coupled with enourmous amount of drumrolls in it. Be careful when hitting those for high scores as you may hit another note by accident! For a fact the drumroll tick in this map is about... 1000? I don't remember but yeah, a drumroll battle in the midst of Hidden mod.

- Wired Life (TV Size) [Muzu]

  A muzukashii? Actually this is a very old map, to introduce how tricky a hidden can be sometimes.

### Hard Rock

- Mya-nee Canyon [*Noarmal*]

  Another convert map, should be expected with several drumrolls are lining up in the pattern itself. The map itself is fast, however don't be so happy as you may forgot to hit a note.

- Nerverakes [ADVANCED]

  Somewhat old map, this is one of tough futsuu with slow yet faster scroll.

- FLOWER [ADVANCED]

  This map is faster than you could expect in HR itself. To consider this map is part of Tenkaichi Otogesai Pack, this map will not forgive any single mistake, so be careful!
 
### Double Time

- Remilia Pose [Futsuu]

  A short tricky DT map.

- Shukufuku no Kaze [*Donation*]

  A very long DT map. As this is a convert, remember to stay careful with the drumrolls and how the finishers are formed in this map.

- Flandre March (Hard) [*Pair*]

  A harder Flandre March! As you could expect, this is a faster version of Flandre March that you've encountered earlier. The map itself is rather simple what I could say.

### Hidden-Hard Rock

- Mopemope Kids Edition [Kodomotachi no Taiko Asobu]

  This map is meant to teach how to ghosttap along the song. The thing with this map is slow scroll and consistent rhythm. With hidden you may need time to process the input for sure, however due to "how low is the OD" of this map, ghosttapping in this map is extremely recommended. You'll feel the rhythm flowing out yourself when you enjoy this kids friendly edit of LeaF's.
  
### Free Mod

- Festa Illoopmination [Festa Fustuu]

  Another consistency map, however it's harder than the original version.

- La Vie En Rose [REGULAR]

  A simple map. This map is particularly *slower* than you could expect as other **170 BPM maps are**.

### Tie Breaker

- Sakasa Medley [Drahaa]

  A tricky timing map. Maybe a tough choice (can be swapped with lower one). To note that this map is against with Free Mod usage due to the nature of the map.

## Pooling Considerations

- Limited choice of uploaded beatmaps
- Want to aim for beginners, this may not fit for all. Hence all the inputs are welcomed!

## Pool Usage Instructions
